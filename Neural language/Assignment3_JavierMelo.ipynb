    "\n",
    "Decision trees belong to the category of supervised machine learning algorithms utilized by the Train Using AutoML tool. They classify or predict data by answering specific questions with true or false responses. When visualized, the outcome forms a tree structure comprising root, internal, and leaf nodes. The root node marks the initial point, leading to internal nodes and finally, leaf nodes. These leaf nodes signify the ultimate classification groups or numerical values. "

    "\n",
    "Step 1: Entropy Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy (H): Entropy is a measure of disorder or uncertainty in a set of data. For a binary classification problem (two classes - say, 0 and 1), entropy is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "H(D)=−∑i=1cP(i)log⁡2(P(i))\n",
    "\n",
    "Where P(i) is the probability of class ii in the dataset DD. Higher entropy indicates more disorder in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Information Gain Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Gain (IG): Information gain measures the effectiveness of a particular attribute in classifying the data. It is calculated by taking the entropy before the split (H(D)H(D)) minus the weighted entropy after the split (H(D∣A)H(D∣A)) for a specific attribute AA.\n",
    "\n",
    "IG(D,A)=H(D)−∑v∈Values(A)∣Dv∣∣D∣H(Dv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where DvDv​ is the subset of data for which attribute AA has the value vv, ∣Dv∣∣Dv​∣ is the size of DvDv​, and ∣D∣∣D∣ is the size of the original dataset DD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Recursive Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Attribute: Choose the attribute that provides the highest information gain as the decision node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Split Data: Split the dataset into subsets based on the chosen attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat: Recursively apply the above steps to the subsets until a stopping criterion is met (such as reaching a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples in a leaf node).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Decision Tree Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree Structure: The decision tree is formed by structuring nodes based on selected attributes and their splits. The attribute with the highest information gain becomes the root node, and subsequent nodes are created based on further splits using other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: Leaf nodes represent the final class labels after the data has been partitioned and the decision tree is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, selecting attributes and splitting the data based on information gain, the decision tree algorithm finds the optimal structure to classify the data into different classes. "

    "\n",
